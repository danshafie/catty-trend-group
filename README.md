Thanks for the project Motor Trend Group

I used create react app to get up and running quickly. To run this locally you'll need to run `npm install`. After that you can run `npm run start` in the project directory and
the project will run locally [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The pages folder is where you'll find the main page of the site and the favorites page. Components folder is where the none page components live. Config folder is where I placed my api key and user id (this would be harder to get to in a real application).

There's some comments throughout the application. React was perfectly capable of handling state management so no redux was used.

I also used css modules for most of the application as an example of a way to go about modularizing css.
